    "Develop a data science-based solution to optimize Deloitte Tax's process of identifying and refunding overpaid taxes for their clients. Analyze existing data from the client's accounts payable system to discover potential areas of improvement and create a model to streamline the process. Apply the data science process (attached) to historical client project data and present your findings and model to the Deloitte Tax team.\n",

    "Clients provide 4 years’ worth of export data from their accounts payable system. This covers all areas of their business spending, and can cover multiple different tax jurisdictions.\n",
    "Each jurisdiction can have their own way to treat the taxability for the same items.\n",
    "The main output of the work Deloitte teams do currently are determinations for taxability, which can be ‘taxable’ and ‘non-taxable’. Once this determination is made, overpayments are found by finding when taxes have been paid for transactions that are ‘non-taxable’. This field is labeled “Taxability.STATE.Status”\n",
